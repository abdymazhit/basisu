//! UASTC mode lookup table.
//!
//! The first byte of a UASTC block carries the mode in a small prefix code; the
//! low 7 bits index directly into this 128-entry table to recover the mode.

/// Maps the low 7 bits of a UASTC block's first byte to its decoded mode. Modes
/// above 18 are not real UASTC modes and indicate a corrupt block.
